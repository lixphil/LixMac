\_____________________________________________________________________________/



Lix can use the graphics and levels from these games:
Lemmings, Oh no more Lemmings, Holiday Lemmings, and Lemmings 2: The Tribes.
Since these games are copyright-restricted, Lix doesn't contain any of their
files.

The game can still use the legacy terrain. If you have the DOS versions of
the named games, you can take some of their files and put them into the lix
directory structure.



INSTALLING THE TERRAIN
----------------------

From DOS Lemmings 1, take VGAGRx.DAT (with x being any one-digit number) and
GROUNDxO.DAT, optionally also VGASPECx.DAT, and put them into the following
dir structure: (you have to create the directory `./bitmap/orig/' and its
subdirectories first:)
./bitmap/orig/L1/0. Dirt/GROUND0O.DAT
./bitmap/orig/L1/0. Dirt/VGAGR0.DAT
./bitmap/orig/L1/1. Hell/GROUND1O.DAT
./bitmap/orig/L1/1. Hell/VGAGR1.DAT
./bitmap/orig/L1/2. Pastel/GROUND2O.DAT
./bitmap/orig/L1/2. Pastel/VGAGR2.DAT
./bitmap/orig/L1/3. Pillar/GROUND3O.DAT
./bitmap/orig/L1/3. Pillar/VGAGR3.DAT
./bitmap/orig/L1/4. Pillar/GROUND4O.DAT
./bitmap/orig/L1/4. Pillar/VGAGR4.DAT
./bitmap/orig/L1/VGASPEC0.DAT
./bitmap/orig/L1/VGASPEC1.DAT
./bitmap/orig/L1/VGASPEC2.DAT
./bitmap/orig/L1/VGASPEC3.DAT

If you have Oh no more Lemmings, you can take the same files (except
VGASPECx.DAT, it doesn't have any), but you must add 5 to the single digit in
each file's name by renaming it:
./bitmap/orig/L1/5. Brick/GROUND5O.DAT
./bitmap/orig/L1/5. Brick/VGAGR5.DAT
./bitmap/orig/L1/6. Rock/GROUND6O.DAT
./bitmap/orig/L1/6. Rock/VGAGR6.DAT
./bitmap/orig/L1/7. Snow/GROUND7O.DAT
./bitmap/orig/L1/7. Snow/VGAGR7.DAT
./bitmap/orig/L1/8. Bubble/GROUND8O.DAT
./bitmap/orig/L1/8. Bubble/VGAGR8.DAT

If you have Holiday Lemmings 1993 or 1994 (I think 1992 does as well), you can
also take the holiday terrain and change the 0 to a 9:
./bitmap/orig/L1/9. Holiday/GROUND9O.DAT
./bitmap/orig/L1/9. Holiday/VGAGR9.DAT

If you have Lemmings 2, you can take the 12 files from its STYLES/ directory.
Because all of these files except for CAVEMAN.DAT are compressed, you need
to decompress them using Mindless' lem2zip.
You can obtain lem2zip here: http://code.google.com/p/lemmings-tools/
Windows users can simply use the executable from the Downloads section,
users of other platforms will have to compile lem2zip on their own.
To decompress files, run "lem2zip -d [filenames]" from the commandline.
For each tribe, make a directory as following, and put the corresponding file
in there. Rename the L2 style files so that only the first letter is capital,
all else is small case (including the extension).
./bitmap/orig/L2/Beach/Beach.dat
./bitmap/orig/L2/Cavelems/Cavelems.dat
./bitmap/orig/L2/Circus/Circus.dat
... a total of 12 of these ...
./bitmap/orig/L2/Sports/Sports.dat
Note that for CAVEMAN.DAT, this file must be named Cavelems.dat
(not Caveman.dat) and its directory must also be called Cavelems.dat.
Windows users can also run the following batch script which produces the L2
folder with the required content instead to ease the process (create a file
decompress.bat in your Lemmings 2 folder with the following content):
	cp -r Styles L2
	for %%b in (Classic Beach Circus Egyptian
	Highland Medieval Outdoor Polar Shadow Space Sports) do (
		md L2\%%b
		lem2zip-0.2.0.exe -d L2\%%b.dat
		mv L2\%%b.dat L2\%%b\%%b.dat
	)
	md L2\Cavelems
	mv L2\Caveman.dat L2\Cavelems\Cavelems.dat
Linux users probably know how to setup a shell script to do the work.

Note that if you're going to include content from those Lemmings games,
you shouldn't distribute your game directory as a whole any more.



USING LEMMINGS LEVELS
---------------------

On the Lix website, you can download a package of multiplayer levels which
use the Lemmings terrain. They were built by Lix players in the past. Extract
the archive in the root directory of the game.

You can take the LEVELxxx.DAT files from Lemmings 1, ONML, and Holiday
Lemmings, and Lix will be able to extract them and play the levels, but note
that all information on level order gets lost in that case. You'd have to
manually sort the extracted .LVL files into the proper ratings.

If you have built your own levels with Lemmix Level Editor, LemEdit or a
similar program, you can load these levels with Lix as well, provided you
have installed the graphics from the corresponding Lemmings games.

Put your single .LVL levels or .DAT level packs into subdirectories of the
level directory. Lix will unpack .DAT packs automatically, and determine the
graphics set based on the subdirectory structure you put the files in:

(anywhere)

    You can create any subdirectory hierarchy of levels/, put the .LVL or
    .DAT files in there, and it will work. This makes Lix read out the graphics
    set information and use it unmodified. The used set will be:

    0 = L1 Dirt
    1 = L1 Hell
    2 = L1 Pastel
    3 = L1 Pillar
    4 = L1 Crystal
    5 = ONML Brick
    6 = ONML Rock
    7 = ONML Snow
    8 = ONML Bubble
    9 = Holiday

(with "ONML"/"onml" in the level path)

    Any path with "ONML" or "onml" in its name will work here. This makes Lix
    add the number 5 to the graphics set information from the file before it
    determines which graphics set to use. This is the desired behavior for
    levels taken directly from Oh no more Lemmings.
    
    However, custom-built levels in ONML-styles have the 5 already added in the
    .LVL file and thus shouldn't be added in a directory reading "ONML"/"onml".
    In any way, Lix treats the set numbers in these subdirectories as follows:

    0 = ONML Brick
    1 = ONML Rock
    2 = ONML Snow
    3 = ONML Bubble
    4 = Holiday

(with "Holiday"/"holiday" in the level path)

    Any path with "oliday" in its name will work. A path like
    this currently makes Lix use the Holiday graphics set for the level.
    This is not entirely correct yet, as there are levels like
    "Vacation in Gemland" that require the ONML Rock set instead.
