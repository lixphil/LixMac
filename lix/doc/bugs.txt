\_____________________________________________________________________________/



General

    Linux and Mac issues
        Use Allegro 4.2 to compile it under Linux if things seem choppy with
        Allgero 4.4. Mac users can try to compile the game from source, or
        take a look at Phil's Mac port of the game, although that is currently
        out of date.

    Directory structure
        To suit Linux package managers better, the game should read levels
        from a global unmodifiable directory as well as from a user directory.
        Inside the game, these directories should be merged. Same goes for
        terrain graphics and config files. All of this should be optional,
        i.e. one could also fare well with the current everything-in-one-dir
        structure.



Menu

    GUI color
        Switching a user in the options doesn't recolor the GUI to the new
        user's settings.

    Hotkeys
        The menu should be fully keyboard-controllable.

    Replay default name
        When saving a replay file, guess a good default name, e.g. the same
        as the level file or level title. In each save browser, focus the
        text entry on startup.



Editor

    Multiple selection and copying
        Selecting multiple parts (with [Ctrl] or the set hotkey) and then
        copying everything does not guarantee correct z-order of the newly
        copied parts.

    Mirroring interactives
        This moves the elements sometimes, even if it doesn't rotate them.



Gameplay physics

    Exploder flinging
        Clam tested it in Lix. What happens is actually the opposite of what
        I said should happen:
        -   If the second one bombs, it flings the first straight up
        -   If the first one bombs, it flings the second one forward

        Also, test assignment priority for stacked lixes. Inconsistent results?



Gameplay non-physics

    Buttons and hotkeys
        During intense networking action, when a player selects skills with
        the keyboard hotkeys, the buttons may flicker. To remedy this, select
        the on/off graphic effect of a button during the draw step instead of
        instantly.

    Two sounds from one lix at same time
        Due to the implementation of the effect manager, the same lix may
        only issue one sound to be played per update. If you jump into a trap
        that kills the lix on the exact frame after the jumper assignment,
        the trap/burn/kill sound won't play.



Data/Images

    Sound replacements
        The sounds aren't fully replaced yet. See doc/sound.txt for details.



Network game

    [Esc] pressed during game
        It runs on properly, but cursor still opens over lixes.
