Hi all,

Inside this directory is where I will commit all of my levels.

There are four directories inside this one representing each major difficulty. My idea is to create my own organized levelset which eventually will be suitable for anyone to play, so I decided to give each difficulty a name. 

Also, each level will be possible without the need for slow-mo/savestates. But I will allow pausing, since that is intended in the original Lemmings.

Currently, all level files will use bitmap files from <lix>/bitmap/Rebuilds. Rebuilds has told me that the directory structure of the bitmaps is subject to change, so I'll use the current structure on this repository for now.

I'm not sure what the plans for an official Lix levelset are at the moment, but in the meantime I'd like to do my own :)

So, over time hopefully this will gradually develop to become suitable for the public.

Have fun!
