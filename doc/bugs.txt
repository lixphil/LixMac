General

    Linux and Mac issues
        Use Allegro 4.2 to compile it under Linux if things seem choppy with
        Allgero 4.4. Mac users can try to compile the game from source, or
        take a look at Phil's Mac port of the game, although that is currently
        out of date.

    Directory structure
        To suit Linux package managers better, the game should read levels
        from a global unmodifiable directory as well as from a user directory.
        Inside the game, these directories should be merged. Same goes for
        terrain graphics and config files. All of this should be optional,
        i.e. one could also fare well with the current everything-in-one-dir
        structure.



Menu

    Highscores of aging levels
        If a highscore sees that (its level file) is older than (the same
        level's version (the highscore was done for)), we shall generate the
        same error as for (when the level is too new).

    GUI color
        The color of the GUI elements should be choosable by editing the config
        file. I don't know whether it should be a hidden option (like setting
        the UDP port to something else) or not, i.e. whether it's offered in
        the options menu.

    Hotkeys
        The menu should be fully keyboard-controllable.

    Replay default name
        When saving a replay file, guess a good default name, e.g. the same
        as the level file or level title. In each save browser, focus the
        text entry on startup.



Editor

    Multiple selection and copying
        Selecting multiple parts (with [Ctrl] or the set hotkey) and then
        copying everything does not guarantee correct z-order of the newly
        copied parts.

    Mirroring interactives
        This moves the elements sometimes, even if it doesn't rotate them.

    Pulling out of top left
        Set the grid to 1. With the mouse, grab a piece and pull it out of the
        top left of a non-torus map. It will move too fast.



Gameplay physics

    Exploder flinging
        I tested it in Lix. What happens is actually the opposite of what you
        said should happen:
        -   If the second one bombs, it flings the first straight up
        -   If the first one bombs, it flings the second one forward

        Also, test assignment priority for stacked lixes. Inconsistent results?

    Ascender should appear at 6 hi-res
        The lixes should ascend more in general.



Gameplay non-physics

    Multiple Hatches screen start
        In multiplayer, if the player will have multiple hatches, the screen
        start coordinates aren't calculated properly if the best point is
        a torus-seam-using combination of the hatch coordinations.

    Buttons and hotkeys
        During intense networking action, when a player selects skills with
        the keyboard hotkeys, the buttons may flicker. To remedy this, select
        the on/off graphic effect of a button during the draw step instead of
        instantly.

    Two sounds from one lix at same time
        Due to the implementation of the effect manager, the same lix may
        only issue one sound to be played per update. If you jump into a trap
        that kills the lix on the exact frame after the jumper assignment,
        the trap/burn/kill sound won't play.

    Disrupt replay with skill key
        Clicking on a skill button aborts an action replay. Pressing their
        hotkeys should do the same.

    Extra hatch sound
        When restarting the level, the hatches make a sound immediately
        at the beginning, and then one more when they're actually opening.



Data/Images

    Ice hatch
        The ice hatch in Matt's winter set has a nonconstant pixel on its
        border, which shouldn't animate.

    Sound replacements
        The sounds aren't fully replaced yet. See doc/sound.txt for details.



Network game

    [Esc] pressed during game
        It runs on properly, but cursor still opens over lixes.
