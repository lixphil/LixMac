I assume you're on Linux. On Windows, you might be better off just using the
provided executable instead of building the game yourself. On Mac OS, most of
the Linux instructions remain similar.

The game is written in C++.



NECESSARY LIBRARIES
-------------------

    Allegro 4.2 (or 4.4) - graphics/game routines library
    enet 1.3             - networking library using UDP

(If you're in the experimental Allegro 5 branch, install Allegro 5 instead of
or in addition to Allegro 4.x. Although these two Allegro versions are
incompatible, they can happily coexist in /usr/local/lib/.)

(You can use enet 1.2 if you absolutely want to. You cannot connect to other
people who built the game with enet 1.3, and have to change 2 lines in the
Lix source code. You can find them by trying to compile the game and have
the compiler choke on these lines. The source comments next to these lines
explain how to change them for enet 1.2. Still, I advise to use enet 1.3.)



BUILD PROCESS
-------------

Install the libs to /usr/local/lib, then run ldconfig if necessary. If you
don't want to install the libs into that directory, you might have to edit
the Makefile in the Lix root dir accordingly.

Finally, invoke make from the Lix root dir, where Makefile sits. It should
build two binaries, ./bin/lix and ./bin/lixserv. Both should be run with the
Lix root dir as the working directory, not ./bin/.

I didn't intend the game to be installed further in any way. All files reside
in a single directory somewhere under the user's home directory. Uninstall
the game by deleting that directory.

If you get problems, feel free to contact me. :-) See readme.txt for details.
