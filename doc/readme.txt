1. OVERVIEW
-----------

Lix is a singleplayer puzzle game, and a multiplayer action puzzle game.
It's inspired by the 1991 game Lemmings by DMA Design.

There is a level editor included in the game. You can design your own levels
and maps with it.

Play in a group of up to eight friends via LAN or the internet. Try to
lead as many lixes as possible into your goal, even your opponents' lixes
-- should they let you.

For info about the multiplayer game modes, read the proper chapter below.

If you own some of the Lemmings games, you can add their graphics and levels
to Lix. Read the corresponding chapter below for how to do it.

If you encounter any problems, read techfaq.txt in this directory.



2. LICENSE
----------

Lix is free software. You can do whatever you like with it. Alter the levels,
graphics, sound effects and even the game itself (source is available) to your
pleasure, and then give copies to everyone and their neighbor.

You cannot hold me responsible for any damage Lix does to you or your machine.
Don't save your diploma's thesis as a *.txt file and delete it using the
replay menu. ;-)

If you add game content from Lemmings games to Lix, note that the Lemmings
games are still restricted by copyright. You probably shouldn't distribute Lix
with such content already included.

4. COMMAND LINE SWITCHES
------------------------

Under all operating systems, the following switches are available for the
Lix executable (./lpp.exe unter Windows, ./lpp under Linux):

-w      Run Lix in a window with a resolution of 640 x 480. If you use this
        switch, the in-game options for resolution and windowed mode are
        overridden for that session of Lix.

-n      Asks for your name when starting Lix, no matter if it is enabled or
        disabled in the game options.

-o      Runs the game without loading the sound driver. This might be useful
        under some Linux systems. To prevent loading the driver permanently,
        disable "load sound driver" in the sound options.



5. THE LEVEL EDITOR
-------------------

The level editor can be accessed via the singleplayer menu. Select any level
and hit the edit button on the right side of the screen.

You can activate the context-sensitive button help in the editor by clicking
on the button with the question mark "?". Hover over any editor button to see
what it is good for, or which key it has as a hotkey.

Make good use of these hotkeys. You can change the default key bindings if
you want. At least, learn where the copy hotkey is, it's the most useful.

If you've created some nice levels, you can drop me a line in the Lix Forum or
via email. I've given the website and my contact info in a note above.



6. NETWORKED GAMES
------------------

Lix can be played together with friends via LAN or the internet. You may
play on the central server, or have a member of your peer group host a game.
In that case, he has to make sure that port 22934 over UDP is open.

The rules for the multiplayer game are as following. Everyone controls his
own horde of lixes, you can only assign skills to your own lixes.
Try to get as many lixes into the goal that displays your player color.
It doesn't matter whose lixes they are. You will want to lead your
opponents' lixes in there as well for extra points...

If a player has no more lixes due to saving, losing or nuking them all,
overtime will start. This is a time limit for the other players to catch up to
his score of saved lixes. The countdown will not trigger if the
lix-less player has not yet saved a single lix. This is to prevent evil
persons from nuking their horde right at the start to spoil the game for
everyone else.



7. ORIGINAL LEMMINGS TERRAIN AND LEVELS
---------------------------------------

Lix can use the graphics and levels from these games:
Lemmings, Oh no more Lemmings, Holiday Lemmings, and Lemmings 2: The Tribes.
Since these games are copyright-restricted, Lix doesn't contain any of their
files.

If you have these old games, you can use their terrain in Lix. For information
on how to do this, read the file oldterr.txt in this directory.



AND NOW
-------

Have fun playing Lix!
