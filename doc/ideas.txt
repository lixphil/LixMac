This file contains a few more elaborate ideas. It differs from the wishlist
(see wishes.txt) because ideas aren't as neatly categorized here; instead I
will just ramble on about single things.



-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

These would be nice multiplayer modes to have some time. Both me and Clam
Spammer have made levels that'd profit from them.

The game supports the following special game modes, which can be freely
combined with each other. The default game described up to here has
all of these game modes are deactivated.

CTF

    When CTF is activated, players get points only for saving neutral lixes.
    Player-controlled lixes of any color will still enter the exits, but
    aren't worth any points.

    When CTF is off, players get points for saving lixes regardless of their,
    color, i.e. their own, their opponents', or neutral lixes.

SUDDEN DEATH

    When Sudden Death is activated, the game will immediately end after any
    player scores a point. There will be no overtime. What scores a point
    depends on whether the CTF option is used or not.

    When Sudden Death isn't used, play will continue normally. Overtime kicks
    in after a player with a nonzero score has no more of his own lixes. The
    game is over when there are no more lixes in the level, neutral or
    player-owned. The neutral lixes will be nuked when there are no more
    player lixes, or as usual when overtime has run out.

SKILL TRANSFER

    When Skill Transfer is activated, then using a skill during the game
    results in some other player gaining one additional usage of the same
    skill. The opponent who gains the skill is determined by a hidden counter
    per player, which cycles to the next opponent after each skill transfer
    and skips players that have no more lixes.

    When a player has no more lixes on the level, all of his skills are
    transferred to the other players. This is also done with the hidden
    counter to ensure a roughly evenly transfer to everyone.

    When Skill Transfer is switched off, skills are gone for good when they
    are used up. The level should start with a rich skillset to compensate.
