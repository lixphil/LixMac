Use this file to configure your special objects. Make a copy of this file,
put it into the same directory as your object, and give it the same filename as
the object except for its ending, which must be .txt. If your object is
bitmap/somedir/goal.G.bmp, then this definitions file must be
bitmap/somedir/goal.G.txt to get it to work.

All lines that don't start with a # are ignored. Decide which of the following
commands you need, you can select as many as you want. Then remove their
trailing spaces (but not the #) and edit their numbers. After you're done,
you can safely delete all other lines that don't start with # to save space,
i.e. delete all this blah-blah text and unused commands.

 #TRIGGER_AREA_POSITION_ABSOLUTE_X 20
Remove the space before the # to use this command. This will happen:
The left edge of the trigger area will be placed the given amount of pixels
away from the left edge of the object. If you want to center the trigger area
horizontally, use TRIGGER_AREA_POSITION_FROM_CENTER_X instead, see below.

 #TRIGGER_AREA_POSITION_ABSOLUTE_Y 10
Remove the space before the # to use this command. This will happen:
The upper edge of the trigger area will start this amount of pixels away from
the upper edge of the object. If you want to center the trigger area
vertically or place it at the bottom of the object, use one
of TRIGGER_AREA_POSITION_FROM_CENTER_Y or TRIGGER_AREA_POSITION_FROM_BOTTOM_Y
instead, see below.

 #TRIGGER_AREA_POSITION_FROM_CENTER_X -5
Remove the space before the # to use this command. This will happen:
The center (not left edge) of the trigger area will be placed the given amount
of pixels away from the horizontal center of the object. Use positive values to
shift the trigger area to the right, and negative values to shift to the left.

 #TRIGGER_AREA_POSITION_FROM_CENTER_Y -12
Remove the space before the # to use this command. This will happen:
The center (not upper edge) of the trigger area will be placed the given amount
of pixels away from the vertical center of the object. Use positive values to
shift the trigger area down, and negative values to pull it further up.

 #TRIGGER_AREA_POSITION_FROM_BOTTOM_Y 0
Remove the space before the # to use this command. This will happen:
The center (not upper edge) of the trigger area will be placed the given amount
of pixels away from the bottom of the object. Positive values will push it
even further down, negative values pull it up. If you use this command and
give 0 as the number, the center will be on the second-to-last pixel row
vertically. This is the default setting for goals (exits).

 #TRIGGER_AREA_SIZE_X 20
Remove the space before the # to use this command. This will happen:
Instead of its default width, the trigger area will use the given amount of
pixels as its width.

 #TRIGGER_AREA_SIZE_Y 20
Remove the space before the # to use this command. This will happen:
Instead of its default height, the trigger area will use the given amount of
pixels as its height.

The following commands exist, but won't do anything yet; you cannot make
custom fling objects yet.
 #FLING_SPEED_AHEAD
 #FLING_SPEED_X
 #FLING_SPEED_Y
 #COOLDOWN
