This file is about the directory and file structure of Lix. It also describes
the file formats Lix uses. It can be useful if you design levels or graphics,
work with the source code, or simply want to understand how everything works.



TABLE OF CONTENTS
-----------------





GRAPHIC FILE GRIDS
------------------

Some of Lix's graphic files define animations instead of regular pictures.
The game still uses BMP, TGA or PCX for these animations, and expects there
to be a grid with equally sized cells.

If a graphic contains an animation of XF frames aligned horizontally in the
grid, YF frames aligned vertically, and each frame is of width W and height
H, then the complete graphic file has a width of (W*XF + XF + 1) and a height
of (H*YF + YF + 1).

The grid should be of a color that doesn't appear inside any frame itself.
This grid consists of lines with a thickness of 1 pixel. It can be explained
best with a picture. This is what a file with 3 columns (XF = 3) and 2 rows
(YF = 2) has for its grid -- the letters x represent single pixel lines:

    xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
    x    x    x    x
    x    x    x    x
    xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
    x    x    x    x
    x    x    x    x
    xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

Look at ./bitmap/data/lemming.I.bmp for more examples. Interactive objects
use only a single row of frames (YF = 1), see their section for more
information.



DESIGNING TERRAIN
-----------------

You can draw your own terrain graphics and include them in Lix.

All terrain files should be in ./bitmap/ or a subdirectory thereof. If you're
going to make several pieces of terrain, consider making your own subdirectory.

The game can read BMP, TGA and PCX files. Try to give the correct extension
to your file. The color depth can be anything, because the game converts the
graphic to its own depth (usually 16 bit) when the graphic file gets loaded.

Each file contains exactly one terrain piece, and this piece will be generated
from all the pixels in the file. You don't draw a 1x1 grid into the file first.

Use bright pink (255 red, 0 green, 255 blue) for transparent/non-solid areas
of the terrain piece.

Save the file when you're done, and open Lix. The editor's terrain browser
allows you to navigate the subdirectories of ./bitmap/ and insert your terrain
piece into a level.



DESIGNING STEEL
---------------

Steel objects are made almost in the same way as regular terrain objects,
with the following exception: Name your file somename.S.bmp, somename.S.tga,
or somename.S.pcx, depending on which graphic format you use.

All files with names ending in .S before their extension are treated as steel
by the game.



DESIGNING INTERACTIVE OBJECTS
-----------------------------

These objects are entrance hatches, goals, traps, etc.

Read the above section about designing terrain first. Interactive objects are
made in the same way, with the exceptions described as follows.

You have to give a special extension to the interactive object files, so that
the game knows which kind of object they are. Name your file somename.X.bmp,
somename.X.pcx, or somename.X.tga, with X depending on the object type:

    hatch/entrance  H
    goal/exit       G
    water           W
    fire            F
    decoration      D
    steel           S

Steel isn't an interactive object, and thus requires no grid. See also the
section above for steel.

All other objects are animated, and all frames are drawn into a single file
Before you start, decide on the object's width and height, and decide on
the number of animation frames. Draw a grid with a just single row, but one
column for each frame. To understand this, read the section about graphic file
grids above, or look at other people's object graphics.

For entrance hatches, the first frame contains the closed hatch, while the last
frame contains the fully opened hatch. The frames in between contain the
animation from closed to fully opened.

Goals, water, fire, and decoration are animated constantly. The animation
cycles through the frames in ascending order, reverting back to the first frame
after the last one. It doesn't matter which frame is the first, simply pick the
nicest-looking one because the editor will display this one.

Traps kill one lem at a time, and display the first frame while waiting for one
to enter. While they kill it, they cycle through the rest of the frames once in
increasing order, reverting back to the first frame afterwards. The more frames
a trap has, the longer it is busy killing one lem.

The trigger area of goals, traps etc. depends on the size of a single frame.
You can edit them manually (see next paragraph) or keep the following defaults.
Hatches spawn lems in their horizontal center and more towards their bottom.
Goals have their trigger area in their horizontal center and exactly at the
bottom of the picture. Water and fire have a trigger area that spans over the
object completely in the horizontal direction, but not completely vertically.
Traps have horizontally centered trigger area, and its vertical location is
around 80 percent down from the top.

If you want to edit the trigger areas or hatch spawn points, you can do so
by adding a .txt file with the same pre-extension name next to your object
graphic file. Read the documentation in ``objdef.txt'' for instructions.
